As you step through the doorway, you find yourself in a spacious room, with high ceilings and walls that seem to stretch on endlessly in every direction. The air is damp and musty, and the only light comes from the torch in your hand, casting flickering shadows across the room. You can feel the weight of the darkness pressing in on you, and the silence is deafening. This is a big room, and you can't help but wonder what secrets it might hold.
