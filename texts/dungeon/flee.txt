As you turn to run away from the battle, you feel a twinge of shame for fleeing. Remember, adventurer, that bravery is not the absence of fear, but the ability to face it. Perhaps with better preparation or strategy, you can face that monster and emerge victorious next time. Keep exploring and growing stronger, and don't let this setback discourage you.
