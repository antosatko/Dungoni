As you make your way out of the dungeon, the weight of shame and disappointment starts to settle in. The voice in your head berates you for giving up so easily. You feel like a coward who couldn't face the challenges ahead. The creatures lurking in the dark corners of the dungeon must be laughing at your feeble attempt to conquer their domain. You know that only a true hero could have braved through the dangers and come out victorious. You can't help but feel like you let yourself down.
