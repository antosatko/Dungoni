If you choose to enter the shop, you will meet the shopkeeper, who will offer you gear for each of the following body parts: head, body, legs, and weapon. The gear's stats are randomly distributed based on your level. You can also buy and sell food. The food has limited supply, and you can choose how much you want to buy. The gear in the shop will reset each time you hit a new level, and the food will reset after you return from the dungeon.
