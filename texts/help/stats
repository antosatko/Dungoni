Stats play a crucial role in determining your character's success in the game. By wisely distributing stat points, you can tailor your character's strengths and weaknesses to your playstyle, making it easier to navigate through the dungeon and defeat monsters.
armor: decreases damage taken upon getting hit
HP: increases your combat HP
damage: increases your damage in combat
luck: chance to increase your damage while attacking, to have monster leave or not appear at all
speed: decreases stamina lost while fleeing from dungeon
