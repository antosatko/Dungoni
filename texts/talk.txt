Greetings adventurer,

I wanted to take a moment to talk to you about this game you're playing. It was created as a bit of a joke, but I hope you find it enjoyable nonetheless.

Remember that this is just a game, and the goal is to have fun. Whether you choose to explore dungeons, visit the shop, or just relax by the campfire, I hope you enjoy your time in this world.

Thank you for playing, and happy adventuring!
